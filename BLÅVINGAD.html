    <p><h3>Did you know that the heart of a blue whale is as big as a car? Imagine how much love that would have to go with it! Let's show him our love by taking care of the wonderful world he lives in.

        The material is recycled polyester and is soft and gentle on sensitive skin.
        
        The filling in this product contains recycled polyester from ocean-based plastic, captured as far as 50 kilometers from coastal areas.
        
        All soft toys are perfect for little ones to cuddle and play with, and are also tested and tested for safety.
        
        We know our tender blood has to deal with many years of love. That's why we chose comfortable materials, embroidered eyes, and ran rigorous wash tests - and made sure they're free of harmful chemicals.
        
        Easy to keep clean and fresh since you can remove the fabric and machine wash it.
